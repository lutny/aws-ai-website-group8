<h2>Data Lakes</h2>
<p>A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store all your structured and unstructured data at any scale. You can run data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and high-performance computing (HPC) applications to unlock the value of your data.</p>
<p>With an Amazon S3 data lake, users in Salesforceâ€™s organization can discover, access, and analyze all their data, regardless of where it lives, in a secure and governed way.</p>
<h2>Backup and Restore Data</h2>
<p>Meet your recovery time objective (RTO), recovery point objective (RPO), and compliance requirements with S3's robust replication functionality, data protection with AWS Backup, and various AWS Partner Network solutions.</p>
<p>Ancestry uses the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes to restore terabytes of images in mere hours instead of days.</p>
<h2>Archive Data</h2>
<p>Move data archives to the Amazon S3 Glacier storage classes to lower costs, eliminate operational complexities, and gain new insights.</p>
<p>The BBC, a UK public service broadcaster, safely migrated its 100-year-old flagship archive to Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval.</p>
<h2>Generative AI</h2>
<p>Because Amazon S3 stores more than 350 trillion objects (exabytes of data) for virtually any use case and averages over 100 million requests per second, it may be the starting point of your generative AI journey.</p>
<p>Grendene is creating a generative AI-based virtual assistant for their sales team using a data lake built on Amazon S3.</p>
